# ParticleSeg3D for the Analysis of Pharmaceutical Tablets
By Darren Chen for the Biomedical Engineering Senior Design Project at the University of Connecticut

## ParticleSeg3D Source Code Implementation
- Use the source code implementation if a greater degree of control over ParticleSeg3D is desired
- Note that multi-GPU processing is supported in the source code implementation
- Access the source code implementation in `Senior_Design/particleseg3d_source` and refer to the local README file for additional information.

## ParticleSeg3D Subprocess Module Implementation
- Use the subprocess module implementation for ease of access and straight out-of-box implementation.
- Note that multi-GPU processing is NOT supported in the subprocess module implementation
- Access the subprocess module implementation in `Senior_Design/particleseg3d_ssubprocess` and see the local README file for additional information.
