# ParticleSeg3D for the Analysis of Pharmaceutical Tablets  
By Darren Chen — Biomedical Engineering Senior Design Project, University of Connecticut (2024–2025)

This branch contains all of Darren's work from the 2024–2025 academic year, focused on adapting and optimizing ParticleSeg3D for pharmaceutical tablet analysis as part of his Senior Design project. It serves as a record of the development process, showcasing the pipeline's progression and iterative improvements.  

For the finalized and optimized pipeline—with cleaned-up code and refined documentation—please refer to the `main` branch. This `Darren` branch reflects the raw, progressive work.

## ParticleSeg3D Source Code Implementation
- Use the source code implementation if a greater degree of control over ParticleSeg3D is desired
- Note that multi-GPU processing is supported in the source code implementation
- Access the source code implementation in `Senior_Design/particleseg3d_source` and refer to the local README file for additional information.
- ***Note the different directory and formatting requirements for metadata files from the original authors' implementation!

## ParticleSeg3D Subprocess Module Implementation
- Use the subprocess module implementation for ease of access and straight out-of-box implementation.
- Note that multi-GPU processing is NOT supported in the subprocess module implementation
- Access the subprocess module implementation in `Senior_Design/particleseg3d_subprocess` and see the local README file for additional information.
